A virtual assistant, also called AI assistant or digital assistant, is an application program that understands natural language voice commands and completes tasks for the user.

Such tasks, historically performed by a personal assistant or secretary, include taking dictation, reading text or email messages aloud, looking up phone numbers, scheduling, placing phone calls and reminding the end user about appointments.

 Popular virtual assistants currently include Amazon Alexa, Apple's Siri, Google Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana
